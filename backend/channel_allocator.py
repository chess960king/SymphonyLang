channel_allocator.py
Assigns each TRACK a MIDI channel (0-15) such that no two tracks that are
declared to play SIMULTANEOUSLY (i.e. grouped inside the same PARALLEL
block) ever share a channel.

THIS IS THE SAME ALGORITHM FAMILY AS REGISTER ALLOCATION IN REAL COMPILERS.
Real compilers must assign a small number of physical CPU registers to
many variables, making sure two variables that are "alive" at the same
time never get the same register. They solve this with GRAPH COLORING:
    1. Build an "interference graph": one node per variable (here: per
       track), with an edge between two nodes if they're alive at the
       same time (here: declared to play simultaneously).
    2. Color the graph so that connected nodes never share a color.
       Each distinct color = one register (here: one MIDI channel).

We use a simple GREEDY coloring algorithm: real compilers often use more
sophisticated coloring (Chaitin's algorithm, Briggs' optimistic coloring),
but greedy coloring demonstrates the exact same underlying idea and is
easy to verify by hand for a report.

Channel 9 is reserved for percussion by the General MIDI standard, so any
track named "Drums" is pinned to channel 9 up front and excluded from the
graph coloring process entirely (it can't conflict with anything else
since it's on its own dedicated channel).
